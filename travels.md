Traveling around Spain with Mom and Dad. Particularly the unique hotel in Ronda next to the gorge. What an incredible view!
London for Moon's 21st birthday celebration. My first clubbing experience and the craziness that ensued.
Panama City Beach for the nostalgia trip. Had some unexpected bumps, but overall, what a wonderful trip!
